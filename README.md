# QM_ItemCreatorTool

## Quick Guide
- First, subscribe to the mod "Item and Weapon Importer" in the workshop.
- Open the tool and add configure weapons, receipts and optionally the localization
- When you've finished, click "Create Mod" in the "General" Tab
	- Select the workshop folder as directory
- Start the game and use the console to spawn the new weapon!

## IMAGES AND SOUND
For the paths to images or sounds, please copy & paste the full path
or
Use the provided button to navigate to the file.
### Note: The mod will manually copy and update the paths

## CREATE MOD
To create the mod files, press the "Create Mod" in the "General" tab
A window will open, you must navigate to the folder where the base config file and mod folders containing the data will be created.
My recommendation is an empty folder, or the QM_WeaponImporter mod folder (as it will load files inside automatically)
Item and Weapon Importer Mod ID is: 3284022031

### Note that "Create Mod" will OVERRIDE all previous configuration files existing

## TESTING
And that's it, open the console in the inventory or in a mission and type: 
- item "YourWeaponID"
If it spawns, success! If it doesn't, check the logfile located in the Item and Weapon mod.
